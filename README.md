## üöÄ Deployment & Installation

We recommend using the provided setup script for deploying HostPanel Pro on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VPS. For other operating systems, manual installation, or local development, please see the manual setup instructions below.

### VPS Deployment with Setup Script (Recommended for Ubuntu 22.04)

This method uses a script to automate the initial server setup, including installing necessary dependencies like Nginx, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and configuring the firewall.

**About the Script (`scripts/vps_setup_ubuntu2204.sh`):**

*   **Purpose:** Automates the initial setup of an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server and deploys the HostPanel Pro application.
*   **Automates:**
    *   Creation of a new non-root user with `sudo` privileges (prompts for username/password).
    *   Installation of essential utilities: `git`, `curl`, `wget`, `build-essential`.
    *   Installation of Node.js (LTS), npm, and PM2 process manager.
    *   Installation and basic configuration of Nginx (including proxy to Node.js app on port 3000).
    *   Installation and basic configuration of PostgreSQL (creates a user and database).
    *   Setup of UFW (firewall) with rules for SSH, HTTP, HTTPS.
    *   Installation of Certbot (for Let's Encrypt SSL).
    *   Cloning of the HostPanel Pro repository (uses a placeholder URL, ensure `scripts/vps_setup_ubuntu2204.sh` has the correct one).
    *   Installation of HostPanel Pro application dependencies (`npm install`).
    *   Building of the HostPanel Pro application (`npm run build`).
    *   Creation of a placeholder `.env` file for HostPanel Pro.
    *   Setup of PM2 to manage the HostPanel Pro application.

**Steps:**

1.  **Download/Transfer the Script:**
    *   The script `vps_setup_ubuntu2204.sh` is included in this repository in the `scripts/` directory.
    *   Upload it to your server (e.g., using `scp`):
        ```bash
        scp ./scripts/vps_setup_ubuntu2204.sh your_vps_user@your_vps_ip:~/
        ```
        *(Replace `your_vps_user` and `your_vps_ip` with your server details. This initial user might be `root` or a user provided by your VPS host).*

2.  **Make Executable:**
    *   Log in to your VPS via SSH.
    *   Navigate to where you uploaded the script and make it executable:
        ```bash
        chmod +x vps_setup_ubuntu2204.sh
        ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    *   Execute the script with `sudo` privileges:
        ```bash
        sudo ./vps_setup_ubuntu2204.sh
        ```
    *   The script will prompt you to enter a username and password for the new non-root user it will create. Follow the on-screen instructions.

**Post-Script Setup (Crucial Manual Steps):**

After the script completes, you **must** perform these steps:

1.  **DNS Configuration:**
    *   Point your domain name (e.g., `panel.yourdomain.com`) to your server's public IP address. This is done via your domain registrar or DNS provider.

2.  **Nginx Configuration:**
    *   Log in as the new user created by the script.
    *   Edit the Nginx site configuration file (the script will tell you the placeholder path, typically `/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain.com`):
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain.com
        ```
        *(Replace `your_domain.com` with the actual placeholder filename used by the script if different)*.
    *   Update `server_name` with your actual domain (e.g., `panel.yourdomain.com`). The script pre-configures `proxy_pass` to `http://localhost:3000`. If your application's `.env` file specifies a different `PORT`, ensure the `proxy_pass` port in Nginx matches it.
    *   Test Nginx configuration and reload:
        ```bash
        sudo nginx -t
        sudo systemctl reload nginx
        ```

3.  **Application Environment Configuration (`.env` file):**
    *   **CRITICAL:** The script creates a placeholder `.env` file in the application directory (`/home/your_new_username/hostpanel-pro/.env`). You **must** edit this file:
        ```bash
        sudo nano /home/your_new_username/hostpanel-pro/.env
        ```
        *(Replace `your_new_username` with the actual username you provided to the script).*
    *   Fill in the following:
        *   `DB_PASSWORD`: The password you set for the PostgreSQL user during the script's execution.
        *   `JWT_SECRET`: A strong, unique random string for session security.
        *   Review other settings like `PORT` (if you changed it from the default 3000), SMTP details, etc.
    *   After saving the `.env` file, restart the HostPanel Pro application using PM2 for the changes to take effect:
        ```bash
        sudo -u your_new_username pm2 restart hostpanel-pro
        ```

4.  **SSL Certificate (Let's Encrypt):**
    *   Once DNS has propagated and Nginx is configured with your actual domain, run Certbot:
        ```bash
        sudo certbot --nginx -d panel.yourdomain.com # Replace with your actual domain
        ```
    *   Follow Certbot's prompts. It will automatically update your Nginx configuration for SSL.

5.  **Access HostPanel Pro:**
    *   You should now be able to access HostPanel Pro at `https://panel.yourdomain.com`.
    *   Check PM2 logs if you encounter issues: `sudo -u your_new_username pm2 logs hostpanel-pro`.

### Manual Installation / Local Development

These steps are for setting up a local development environment or for manually installing on operating systems other than Ubuntu 22.04 (where the script is not applicable).

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hostpanel-pro.git
cd hostpanel-pro

# 2. Install Node.js and npm
# (Refer to Node.js official documentation for your OS)
# Example for Ubuntu/Debian:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Build application (for production preview or manual deployment)
npm run build

# 5. Start development server (for local development)
npm run dev
```
This starts a local development server (usually on `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

**For manual production deployment (without the VPS script):**
You would need to:
1.  Set up a web server (Nginx or Apache).
2.  Configure it to serve the built static files (from `dist` or `build` folder) or proxy to your Node.js server process.
3.  Set up a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
4.  Configure environment variables for HostPanel Pro.
5.  Use a process manager like PM2 to keep your application running.
6.  Set up SSL certificates.
